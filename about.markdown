We are a team of Johns Hopkins University Computer Science and Public Health researchers spreading verified information during COVID-19.
Our effort is led by [Jo√£o Sedoc](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/joao-sedoc/) (Computer Science) and [Smisha Agarwal](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2943/smisha-agarwal) (Public Health)

This effort leverages technologies developed under support from organizations such as DARPA (the DEFT, LORELEI, AIDA, KAIROS programs), IARPA (BETTER) and from the JHU HLTCOE.
