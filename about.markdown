We are a team of Johns Hopkins University Computer Science and Public Health researchers spreading verified information during COVID-19.
Our effort is led by [Jo√£o Sedoc](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/joao-sedoc/) (Computer Science) and [Smisha Agarwal](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2943/smisha-agarwal) (Public Health).


This effort leverages technologies developed under the support of organizations such as DARPA[^1] (the DEFT[^2], LORELEI[^3], AIDA[^4], and KAIROS[^5] programs) and the JHU HLTCOE[^6].
