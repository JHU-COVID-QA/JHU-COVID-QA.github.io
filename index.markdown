We are a team of Johns Hopkins University Computer Science and Public Health researchers disseminating verified information during COVID-19.
Our effort is led by [João Sedoc](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/joao-sedoc/) (Computer Science) and [Smisha Agarwal](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2943/smisha-agarwal) (Public Health)


We have collected 1000’s of verified questions and answers from online trusted sources. We will share this verified
questions and answers.

We are deploying a chatbot style interface for asking questions against this collection.  We are refining algorithms as well as data for this task: our experts in public health are incrementally assessing our ability to match your questions to our answers, as well as writing or editing new answers to questions we could not already answer.  Our “Frequently-Asked-Questions” Bot, or FAQ-bot, will iteratively be improved as we continue to: collect available resources made available online, annotate additional data for refining our QA model, and through feedback from you the user, who can let us know whether answers we are providing are clear or at least relevant to what you are looking for.
