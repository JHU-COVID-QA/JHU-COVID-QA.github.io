We are a team of Johns Hopkins University Computer Science and Public Health researchers spreading verified information during COVID-19.
Our effort is led by [Jo√£o Sedoc](https://sites.google.com/site/jsedoc/) (Computer Science) and [Smisha Agarwal](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2943/smisha-agarwal) (Public Health)

We have collected 1000's of verified questions and answers from online trusted sources. 
Our team of experiments have annotated and reviewed many of the collected data.
We will release the collected shortly.

We are developing a chatbot that can answer COVID-19 related questions. The chatbot will be available soon.
